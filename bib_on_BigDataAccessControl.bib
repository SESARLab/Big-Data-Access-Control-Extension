Hadoop core platform along with other open-source tools such as Apache Hive, Storm, HBase offer an ecosystem to enable users to fully harness Big Data potential. Apache Ranger and Apache Sentry provide access control capabilities to several ecosystem components by offering centralized policy administration and enforcement through plugins. In this work we discuss the access control model for Hadoop ecosystem (referred as HeAC) used by Apache Ranger (release 0.6) and Sentry (release 1.7.0) along with Hadoop 2.x native authorization capabilities. This multi-layer model provides several access enforcement points to restrict unauthorized users to cluster resources. We further outline some preliminary approaches to extend the HeAC model consistent with widely accepted access control models.},

Apache Ranger and Apache Sentry are two predominant frameworks used to provide authorization capabilities in Hadoop ecosystem. In this paper we present a formal multi-layer access control model (called {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}HeAC{\}}{\$}{\$}) for Hadoop ecosystem, as an academic-style abstraction of Ranger, Sentry and native Apache Hadoop access-control capabilities. We further extend {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}HeAC{\}}{\$}{\$}base model to provide a cohesive object-tagged role-based access control (OT-RBAC) model, consistent with generally accepted academic concepts of RBAC. Besides inheriting advantages of RBAC, OT-RBAC offers a novel method for combining RBAC with attributes (beyond NIST proposed strategies). Additionally, a proposed implementation approach for OT-RBAC in Apache Ranger, is presented. We further outline attribute-based extensions to OT-RBAC.}

A Fuzzy IBE scheme allows for a private key for an identity, $\omega$, to decrypt a ciphertext encrypted with an identity, $\omega$ {\textasciiacutex}, if and only if the identities $\omega$ and $\omega$ {\textasciiacutex} are close to each other as measured by the ``set overlap'' distance metric. A Fuzzy IBE scheme can be applied to enable encryption using biometric inputs as identities; the error-tolerance property of a Fuzzy IBE scheme is precisely what allows for the use of biometric identities, which inherently will have some noise each time they are sampled. Additionally, we show that Fuzzy-IBE can be used for a type of application that we term ``attribute-based encryption''.}

How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k- anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, Âµ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.},

The chapter refers to NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (BDRA) and summarizes general requirements to Big Data systems described in NIST documents. The proposed BDI and its cloud-based components are defined in accordance with the NIST BDRA and BDAF. This chapter provides detailed analysis of the two bioinformatics use cases as typical example of the Big Data applications that have being developed by the authors in the framework of the CYCLONE project. The effective use of cloud for bioinformatics applications requires maximum automation of the applications deployment and management that may include resources from multiple clouds and providers. The proposed CYCLONE platform for multicloud multiprovider applications deployment and management is based on the SlipStream cloud automation platform and includes all necessary components to build and operate complex scientific applications. The chapter discusses existing platforms for cloud powered applications development and deployment automation, in particularly referring to the SlipStream cloud automation platform, which allows multicloud applications deployment and management. The chapter also includes a short overview of the existing Big Data platforms and services provided by the major cloud services providers which can be used for fast deployment of customer Big Data applications using the benefits of cloud technologies and global cloud infrastructure.}

The major advance in this area is Dynamic Access Control, which makes it possible for you to use claims-based authorization for accessing information on your file servers. This means that you are no longer limited to conventional user/group-based access control. Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 also introduced a new method for logging onto computers called Picture Password. With Picture Password, the user can select a picture and then perform a number of gestures on the picture. The picture and the gestures are packaged with the user's user name and password. The user can then log on by being presented with the picture and repeating the gestures, which will open the package and expose the user name and password to the system. In this chapter, we will look at how these technologies work and how to implement them.}

Thus accurate prediction of the availability of these resources can significantly improve the performance of executing compute-intensive complex scientific and business applications in enterprise Grid environment by avoiding possible runtime failures. In this paper, we propose a Jaccard Index based prediction approach utilizing lazy learning algorithm that searches for a best match of a sequence pattern in the historical data in order to predict the availability of a particular machine in the system. We compare it against three other well known availability prediction techniques using simulation based study. The experimental results show that our Jaccard Index based prediction approach achieves better prediction accuracy with reduced computational complexity when compared to other similar techniques.}

This paper seeks to begin the process of designing data protection controls into clouds from the outset so as to avoid the costs associated with bolting on security as an afterthought. Our approach is firstly to consider cloud maturity from an enterprise level perspective, describing a novel capability maturity model. We use this model to explore privacy controls within an enterprise cloud deployment, and explore where there may be opportunities to design in data protection controls as exploitation of the Cloud matures. We demonstrate how we might enable such controls via the use of design patterns. Finally, we consider how Service Level Agreements (SLAs) might be used to ensure that third party suppliers act in support of such controls.",
