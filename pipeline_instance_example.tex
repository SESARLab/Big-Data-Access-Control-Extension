\begin{example}\label{ex:instance}

  As an example, let us consider the pipeline template \tChartFunction in \cref{sec:example}.
  It includes three key stages in our reference scenario: data anonymization (\vi{1}), data enrichment (\vi{2}), and data aggregation (\vi{3}), each stage with its policy $p$.



  The filtering algorithm then returns the set $S'=\{s_1,s_2\}$.
  The comparison algorithm is finally applied to $S'$ and returns a ranking of the services according to quality metrics, where $s_1$ is ranked first. $s_1$ is then selected and integrated in $\vii{1}\in \Vp$.

  The comparison algorithm is finally applied to $S'$ and returns a ranking of the services according to quality metrics, where $s_1$ is ranked first. $s_1$ is then selected and integrated in $\vii{1}\in \Vp$.

  The same logic is applied to the \vi{2} and \vi{3}.
