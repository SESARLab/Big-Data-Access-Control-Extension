\begin{example}\label{ex:instance}

  As an example, let us consider the pipeline template \tChartFunction in \cref{sec:example}.
  It includes three key stages in our reference scenario: data anonymization (\vi{1}), data enrichment (\vi{2}), and data aggregation (\vi{3}), each stage with its policy $p$.

  The first vertex (\vi{1}) responsible for data anonymization is associated with three candidate services that satisfy the functional requirements of the first vertex, namely $s_1$, $s_2$ and $s_3$.
  Services $s_1$ and $s_2$ are annotated with a profile that satisfies the data protection requirements in \P{1}, respectively.
  The third service $s_3$ is annotated with a profile that does not satisfy the data protection requirements in \P{1}.
  The filtering algorithm then returns the set $S'=\{s_1,s_2\}$.
  The comparison algorithm is finally applied to $S'$ and returns a ranking of the services according to quality metrics, where $s_1$ is ranked first. $s_1$ is then selected and integrated in $\vii{1}\in \Vp$.

  The comparison algorithm is finally applied to $S'$ and returns a ranking of the services according to quality metrics, where $s_1$ is ranked first. $s_1$ is then selected and integrated in $\vii{1}\in \Vp$.

  The same logic is applied to the \vi{2} and \vi{3}.
