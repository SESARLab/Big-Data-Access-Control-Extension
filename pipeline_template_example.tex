\subsection{Example}\label{sec:example}
As an example, let us consider a pipeline template $G^{\myLambda,\myGamma}$ as a sequence of three vertices modeling three key stages in our reference scenario: data preparation (\vi{1}), data enrichment (\vi{2}), and data storage (\vi{3}). Each stage is annotated with its policy set \P{i} and functional description \F{i}. Table~\ref{table:example} reports the policies and functional descriptions for each vertex, which are presented in the following.

%\begin{enumerate*}[label=n\arabic*)]
%  \item
The first vertex (\vi{1}) is responsible for data preparation.
It specifies an anonymization policy ($\myLambda(v_1)$) to protect sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII) in the dataset.
The transformation function \TF{1} in $\myGamma(v_1)$ is an empty function \tf{a}, as no functional transformation is required for anonymization.
%   \item

The second vertex (\vi{2}) focuses on data enrichment, where additional information from the states of New York and New Hampshire is integrated into the dataset.
It requires a data enrichment policy ($\myLambda(v_2)$) to ensure that the added data are relevant and comply with privacy regulations.
The transformation function \TF{2} in $\myGamma(v_2$) is an additive function \tf{a}, which merges and integrates the external data with the existing dataset.
  %  \item

  The third vertex (\vi{3}) is responsible for aggregating data, including statistical measures like averages, medians, and some more statistics.
  It follows an aggregation policy ($\myLambda(v_3)$) to define how the aggregation should be performed, and ensure compliance with privacy and security regulations.
  The transformation function \TF{3} in $\myGamma(v_3)$ is a transformation function \tf{t}, which computes the required statistics and aggregates the data.
