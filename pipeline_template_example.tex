\subsection{Example}\label{sec:example}


As an example, let us consider the pipeline template \tChartFunction in \cref{sec:example}.

In this example all the policies referenced are detailed in table \ref{tab:anonymization}.
We assume that the data owner is the Connecticut Prison (CTP) and that this facility has a partnership with two others, namely New York Prison and New Hampshire Prison.

The first stage is responsible for data anonymization. The  policy annotation \P{i}, associated with the first stage,
specifies three degree of anonymization : \emph{none}, \emph{partial}, and \emph{full}.
During service execution, the policy is assessed:
if the service profile match with the data owner, \P{1} is satisfied and the data is not anonymized;
if the service profile match with a partner of the owner, \P{2} is satisfied and the data is partially anonymized;
if the service profile doesn't match with a partner nor with the owner, \P{3} is satisfied and the data is fully anonymized.

The second stage is responsible for data enrichment. The policy annotation $p$, associated with the second stage.
The service should download the dataset from the other partner facilities, enriching the dataset of the Connecticut facility, the policy are the same as the first stage (\p{1},\p{2},p{3}).
if the service is made by the data owner, the owner dataset is not anonymized, but the partner dataset is partially anonymized.
if the service is made by ther partners, the owner dataset is partially anonymized as well as the partner dataset.
if the service is made by a third party, the owner dataset is fully anonymized as well as the partner dataset.





The third stage, responsible for data analysis and statistics, adopts policies analogous to the first stage. The logic remains consistent:
if the service profile match with the data owner, \P{1} is satisfied and the data computation is made on non anonymized data;
if the service profile match with a partner of the owner, \P{2} is satisfied and the data computation is made on partially anonymized data;
if the service profile doesn't match with a partner nor with the owner, \P{3} is satisfied and the data computation is made on fully anonymized data.
The fourth stage is responsible for machine learning tasks:
policy \p{4} applies, thus we always aim to anonymize the dataset to avoid any personal identifiers entering into the machine learning algorithm/model.
The fifth stage is responsible for storing data. As stated in policy annotation \P{5}, if the service is located in the facility itself, the data will not be anonymized.
If the service is located in a partner region, the data will be partially anonymized.

The sixth stage is responsible for data visualization. As stated in policy annotation \P{6}, if the user is member of the facility itself, the data will not be anonymized.
If the user is member of a partner facility, the data will be partially anonymized.
If the user is not member of the facility nor a partner, the data will be fully anonymized.
