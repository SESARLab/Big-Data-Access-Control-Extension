\begin{example}[\bf \pipelineTemplate]\label{ex:template}
Let us consider the reference scenario introduced in \cref{sec:systemmodel}.
\cref{fig:service_composition_template} presents an example of pipeline template consisting of five stages, each one annotated with a policy in \cref{tab:anonymization}.
% We recall that \cref{tab:dataset} shows a sample of our reference dataset.

% 1° NODO %
The first stage consists of three parallel vertices \vi{1}, \vi{2}, \vi{3} for data collection.
Data protection annotations \myLambda(\vi{1}), \myLambda(\vi{2}), \myLambda(\vi{3}) refer to policy \p{0} with an empty transformation \tp{0}.
Functional requirements \F{1}, \F{2}, \F{3}  prescribe a URI as input and the corresponding dataset as output.

The second stage consists of vertex \vi{4}, merging the three datasets obtained at the first stage. Data protection annotation \myLambda(\vi{4}) refers to policies \p{1} and \p{2}, which apply different data transformations depending on the relation between the dataset and the service owner.
% 2° NODO %
If the service owner is also the dataset owner (i.e., \pone), the dataset is not anonymized (\tp{0}). If the service owner is a partner of the dataset owner (i.e., \ptwo), the dataset is anonymized at \emph{level1} (\tp{1}). If the service owner has no partner relationship with the dataset owner, no policy applies.
%if the service owner is neither the dataset owner nor a partner of the dataset owner  (\pthree), the dataset is anonymized level2 (\tp{2}).
Functional requirement \F{4} prescribes $n$ datasets as input and the merged dataset as output.

% 3° NODO %
The third stage consists of vertex \vi{5}  for data analysis.
Data protection annotation \myLambda(\vi{5}) refers to policies \p{1} and \p{2}, as for the second stage.
% The logic remains consistent:
% if the service profile matches with the data owner (\pone), \p{1} matches and level0 anonymization is applied (\tp{0});
% if the service profile matches with a partner of the owner (\ptwo), \p{2} matches and level1 anonymization is applied  (\tp{1});
% if the service profile doesn't match with a partner nor with the owner (\pthree), \p{3} matches and level2 anonymization is applied (\tp{2}).
Functional requirement \F{5} prescribes a dataset as input and the results of the data analysis as output.

% 5° NODO %

The fourth stage consists of vertex \vi{6}, managing data storage. Data protection annotation \myLambda(\vi{6}) refers to policies \p{3} and \p{4}, which apply different data transformations depending on the relation between the dataset and the service region.
If the service region is the dataset origin (\p{3}: $\{(service\_region=dataset\_origin)\}$) , the dataset is anonymized at level $l_0$ (\tp{0}).
If the service region is in a partner region (\p{4}: $\{(service,region={NY,NH})\}$), the dataset is anonymized at level $l_1$ (\tp{1}).
Functional requirement \F{7} prescribes a dataset as input and the URI of the stored data as output.

% 6° NODO %
The last stage consists of vertex \vi{7}, responsible for data visualization.
Data protection annotation \myLambda(\vi{7}) refers to policies \p{5} and \p{6}, which anonymize data according to the environment where the service is executed.
A \emph{risky} environment is defined as a region outside the owner or partner facility.
If the environment is risky (\p{5}), the data are anonymized at level $r_0$ (\tp{3}).
If the environment is not risky (\p{6}), the data are anonymized at level $r_1$ (\tp{4}).
Functional requirement \F{8} prescribes a dataset as input and data visualization interface (possibly in the form of JSON file) as output.

%In summary, this tion has delineated a comprehensive pipeline template. This illustrative pipeline serves as a blueprint, highlighting the role of policy implementation in safeguarding data protection across diverse operational stages.
