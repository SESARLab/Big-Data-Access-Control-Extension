- [ ] The Abstract is not concise, and some of the parts could be moved to the Introduction section.
- [ ] There are some assumptions in the paper. For some assumptions, the paper does not provide the support/comments. The readers may wonder if the assumptions are true in practical scenarios. It could be better if the paper can provide some support or some comments about the assumptions.

- [ ] The evaluation for the proposed approach is still not enough. The performance of the proposed approach should be extensively validated. Although, the work has tested its performance on some metrics, the proposed system should be fully tested on various evaluation metrics in various scenarios so that the real performance can be verified. Considering that the real-world application is more complex, the readers could wonder if the proposed approach is practical to be applied to real-world applications (or how practical the proposed method can be applied to real-world applications). I understand that I may introduce some extra work. In the future work, the authors may consider it.
- [ ] There are some parameters in the algorithms, and the performance of the proposed solution could be affected by the settings of the parameters. The readers may wonder if the paper needs some sensitivity testing so that it can better reflect the real performance of the proposed solution. This can help to fully verify the performance of the proposed solution, and enhance the quality of work.

- [ X ] ~~The caption of Fig. 6 is missing. Also, Fig. 6 is not referred to in the paper.~~
- [ ] The paper needs proofreading, and the presentation of the paper could be improved. There are some typos or grammar errors in the paper. Here are some examples.
  - [ X ] ~~Page 2, Abstract, line 2: “enhance” could be changed to “can enhance”~~
  - [ X ] ~~Page 31, paragraph 3: “present” could be changed to “presents”~~
  - [ X ] ~~Page 33, paragraph 2: “present” could be changed to “presents”~~
  - [ ] Some figures (e.g., Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, ) in the paper are small (e.g., font size) in the printed version, which makes it a little difficult for the readers to clearly see the content in the figures.
- [ X ]  ~~Some terms in the paper are not always consistent. For example, sometimes the paper uses “Fig.”, but sometimes it uses “Figure”.~~
