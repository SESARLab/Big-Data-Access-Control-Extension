\subsection{Metriche/Euristiche}






We experimentally evaluated our approach. In the following of this section, we first present the testing infrastructure adopted in our experiments,
then we discuss the experimental settings, and
finally we discuss the performance of our heuristic algorithm.

\subsubsection{Testing Infrastructure}
We designed and developed a Python-based testing infrastructure that implements x.
Our infrastructure implements a pipeline emulator that simulates the execution of a pipeline of services.
The pipeline emulator has been used to compare the performance of our heuristic algorithm with the optimal solution,
both in terms of execution time and quality of the solution.
