and corresponding heuristic implementation in \cref{subsec:heuristics},
and compare them against the exhaustive approach in Section~\ref{TOADD}.

\subsection{Testing Infrastructure and Experimental Settings}\label{subsec:experiments_infrastructure}
Our testing infrastructure is a Swift-based simulator of a service-based ecosystem, including service execution, comparison, and composition.
The simulator first defines the pipeline template as a sequence of vertexes in the range $3-7$.
We recall that alternative vertexes are modeled in different pipeline templates,
while parallel vertexes only add a fixed execution time that is negligible and do not affect the quality of our approach.
Each node is associated with a (set of) policy with transformations varying in three classes:

\begin{itemize*}[label=roman*]
  \item \textit{Confident}: Adjusts data removal to a percentage within $[0.8,1]$.
  \item \textit{Diffident}: Sets data removal percentage to $[0.2,0.5]$.
  \item \textit{Average}: Modifies data removal percentage within $[0.2,1]$.
\end{itemize*}
set of functionally-equivalent candidate services is randomly generated.

Upon setting the sliding window size, the simulator selects a subset of vertexes along with their corresponding candidate services.
It then generates all possible service combinations for the chosen vertexes.
For each combination, the simulator calculates a metric, selecting the first service from the optimal combination before shifting the sliding window.
When the end of the node list is reached, or when the window size equals the node count, the simulator computes the optimal service combination for the remaining vertexes.

An hash function is to simulate the natural interdependence between services.
This is particularly important when the removal of data by one service may impact another.
By assigning weights to the services using this function, the system aims to reflect the interconnected dynamics among the services.

The simulator is used to assess the performance and quality of our sliding window heuristic in Section \ref{sec:heuristics} for the generation of the best pipeline instance (Section \ref{sec:instance}).
% Performance measures the heuristics execution time in different settings, while quality compares the results provided by our heuristics in terms of selected services with the optimal solution retrieved using the exhaustive approach.
%We note that the exhaustive approach generates the best pipeline instance by executing all possible combinations of candidate services.
%The emulator simplifies the execution of the service composition by removing the service selection phase, which is not relevant for the purpose of the experiment.
Our experiments have been run on a workstation equipped with a 2.40GHz i5-8279U CPU with 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD.
Each experiment was repeated ten times and the results averaged to improve the reliability of the data.

% \subsection{Metriche/Euristiche}
We first calculated the execution time required by our exhaustive solution.
We incrementally varied the number of vertexes and the number of services per node.
The results of these evaluations are presented in \cref{fig:perf_exhaustive}.
As anticipated, the trend in execution times is exponential. \cref{fig:perf_exhaustive} displays the execution time plots,
clearly showing that as the number of vertexes increases, the execution time grows exponentially.
Execution times for up to 5 vertexes and 6 services were computed directly,
while the remaining data points were obtained through interpolation.
Subsequently, the logical extension of this empirical inquiry involves evaluating the execution time efficiency attributable to the implementation of the sliding window heuristic.

We then evaluated our heuristics to quantify the execution time reduction achieved through the application of heuristics.
In this context, the number of vertexes and services per node was incrementally increased,
with the addition of a sliding window whose size was progressively enlarged in each experiment.
The outcomes are depicted in \cref{fig:perf_window}, and as expected,
we observed a marked reduction in execution times with the implementation of the sliding window heuristic.
This empirical evidence highlights the heuristic's ability to reduce computational demands,
an aspect that becomes increasingly pivotal as the problem's complexity grows.
The use of a logarithmic scale to illustrate the results linearizes the exponential growth associated with the exhaustive method,
offering a clear visual confirmation of the heuristic's efficiency in decreasing computational time.


\subsection{Quality}\label{subsec:experiments_quality}
We finally evaluated the quality of our heuristic comparing, where possible, its results with the optimal solution retrieved by executing the exhaustive approach. The latter executes with window size equals to the number of vertexes and provides the best, among all possible, solution.

We recall that we considered three different setting, confident, diffident, average, varying the policy transformations, that is, the amount of data removal at each node. Setting confident assigns to each policy a transformation that changes the amount of data removal in the interval [x,y] (Jaccard coefficient) or decreases the probability distribution dissimilarity in the interval [x,y] (Jensen-Shannon Divergence). Setting diffident assigns to each policy a transformation that changes the amount of data removal in the interval [x,y] (Jaccard coefficient) or decreases the probability distribution dissimilarity in  the interval [x,y] (Jensen-Shannon Divergence). Setting average assigns to each policy a transformation that changes the amount of data removal in the interval [x,y] (Jaccard coefficient) or decreases the probability distribution dissimilarity in  the interval [x,y] (Jensen-Shannon Divergence).
We finally evaluated the quality of our heuristic comparing, where possible,
its results with the optimal solution retrieved by executing the exhaustive approach.
The latter executes with window size equals to the number of services per node and provides the best,
among all possible, solution.

The number of vertexes has been varied from 3 to 7, while the number of services per node has been set from 2 to 6.
The experiments have been conducted with different service data pruning profiles.

% \cref{fig:quality_window} presents our results with setting \hl{confident} and metric Jaccard coefficient. \cref{fig:quality_window}(a)--(e) \hl{aggiungere le lettere e uniformare l'asse y} present the retrieved quality varying the number of vertexes in [3, 7], respectively.

% \hl{aggiungiamo i numeri piu significativi (asse y).}
% From the results, some clear trends emerge. As the number of vertexes increases, the metric values tend to decrease (better data quality) as the window size increases across different node configurations.
% This suggests that the heuristic performs better when it has a broader perspective of the data and services. The trend is consistent across all node cardinalities (from three to seven), indicating that the heuristic's enhanced performance with larger window sizes is not confined to a specific setup but rather a general characteristic of its behavior.
% Finally, the data suggest that while larger window sizes generally lead to better performance,
% there might exist a point where the balance between window size and performance is optimized. \hl{For instance, ...}
% Beyond this point, the incremental gains in metric values may not justify the additional computational resources or the complexity introduced by larger windows.

\cref{fig:quality_window} presents our results
In the figure each chart represents a configuration with a specific number of vertexes, ranging from 3 to 7.
On the x-axis of each chart, the number of services is plotted, which ranges from 2 to 6.
The y-axis represents the metric value, which varies across the charts.
Each chart shows different window sizes, labeled as W Size 1, W Size 2, and so on, corresponding to various metric values.

The initial chart in \cref{sub@fig:windows_quality_good} focusing on a 3-node configuration, reveals that metric values commence at a high of 0.12 and decline to a low of 0.06 as the number of services increases. The chart illustrates that smaller window sizes correspond to higher metric values, with window size one exhibiting the highest values and window size three the lowest. Notably, the metric value for a window size of two is comparable to, or better than, that for a window size of three.

The second chart, detailing a 4-node configuration, displays a similar pattern where metric values start at 0.16 and fall to 0.07 with an increasing number of services. In this configuration, the gap between the metric values for a window size of one is more marked, whereas the disparity between the values for window sizes of two and three is less distinct.

In the third chart, which examines a 5-node configuration, metric values initiate at a peak of 0.17 and decrease to 0.09 as services rise. Here, metric values for window sizes one and two are closely matched, whereas those for window sizes three to five are lower, with the gap between the metric values for window sizes one and five reaching up to 0.02.

The fourth chart, exploring a 6-node configuration, shows metric values starting at 0.20 and diminishing to 0.09 with more services. The variance in metric values for a window size of one is again more noticeable, while values for window sizes three to six are lower, with some overlaps, as seen with window sizes four to six.

Lastly, the fifth chart, presenting a 7-node configuration, indicates that metric values start at 0.28 and reduce to 0.10 as the number of services escalates. The difference in metric values for a window size of one is pronounced, while values for window sizes three to six are lower, with overlapping occurrences similar to those in the 6-node setup. Metric values for window sizes two and three fluctuate between 0.25 and 0.12, while those for window sizes four and five oscillate between 0.22 and 0.1.

It's worth noting
As the number of vertexes increases in each subsequent chart, the relationship between the window size and metric value is depicted,
showing how metric values tend to decrease (better data preservation) as the window size increases across different node configurations.
This suggests that the heuristic performs better when it has a broader perspective of the data it is analyzing.
The trend is consistent across various numbers of vertexes, from three to seven, indicating that the heuristic's enhanced
performance with larger window sizes is not confined to a specific setup but rather a general characteristic of its behavior.
Finally, the data suggest that while larger window sizes generally lead to better performance,
there might exist a point where the balance between window size and performance is optimized.
Beyond this point, the incremental gains in metric values may not justify the additional computational resources or the complexity introduced by larger windows.
