abstract = {Publishing data about individuals without revealing sensitive information about them is an important problem. In recent years, a new definition of privacy called k-anonymity has gained popularity. In a k-anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least k − 1 other records with respect to certain identifying attributes.In this article, we show using two simple attacks that a k-anonymized dataset has some subtle but severe privacy problems. First, an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. This is a known problem. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that k-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks, and we propose a novel and powerful privacy criterion called ℓ-diversity that can defend against such attacks. In addition to building a formal foundation for ℓ-diversity, we show in an experimental evaluation that ℓ-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.},

Hadoop core platform along with other open-source tools such as Apache Hive, Storm, HBase offer an ecosystem to enable users to fully harness Big Data potential. Apache Ranger and Apache Sentry provide access control capabilities to several ecosystem components by offering centralized policy administration and enforcement through plugins. In this work we discuss the access control model for Hadoop ecosystem (referred as HeAC) used by Apache Ranger (release 0.6) and Sentry (release 1.7.0) along with Hadoop 2.x native authorization capabilities. This multi-layer model provides several access enforcement points to restrict unauthorized users to cluster resources. We further outline some preliminary approaches to extend the HeAC model consistent with widely accepted access control models.},

  abstract  = {Hadoop ecosystem provides a highly scalable, fault-tolerant and cost-effective platform for storing and analyzing variety of data formats. Apache Ranger and Apache Sentry are two predominant frameworks used to provide authorization capabilities in Hadoop ecosystem. In this paper we present a formal multi-layer access control model (called {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}HeAC{\}}{\$}{\$}) for Hadoop ecosystem, as an academic-style abstraction of Ranger, Sentry and native Apache Hadoop access-control capabilities. We further extend {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}HeAC{\}}{\$}{\$}base model to provide a cohesive object-tagged role-based access control (OT-RBAC) model, consistent with generally accepted academic concepts of RBAC. Besides inheriting advantages of RBAC, OT-RBAC offers a novel method for combining RBAC with attributes (beyond NIST proposed strategies). Additionally, a proposed implementation approach for OT-RBAC in Apache Ranger, is presented. We further outline attribute-based extensions to OT-RBAC.},

A Fuzzy IBE scheme allows for a private key for an identity, $\omega$, to decrypt a ciphertext encrypted with an identity, $\omega$ {\textasciiacutex}, if and only if the identities $\omega$ and $\omega$ {\textasciiacutex} are close to each other as measured by the ``set overlap'' distance metric. A Fuzzy IBE scheme can be applied to enable encryption using biometric inputs as identities; the error-tolerance property of a Fuzzy IBE scheme is precisely what allows for the use of biometric identities, which inherently will have some noise each time they are sampled. Additionally, we show that Fuzzy-IBE can be used for a type of application that we term ``attribute-based encryption''.},

Suppose the data holder wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k- anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, Âµ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.},

The chapter starts with the analysis of emerging Big Data and data intensive technologies and provides the general definition of the Big Data Architecture Framework (BDAF) that includes the following components: Big Data definition, Data Management including data lifecycle and data structures, generically cloud based BDI, Data Analytics technologies and platforms, and Big Data security, compliance, and privacy. The chapter refers to NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (BDRA) and summarizes general requirements to Big Data systems described in NIST documents. The proposed BDI and its cloud-based components are defined in accordance with the NIST BDRA and BDAF. This chapter provides detailed analysis of the two bioinformatics use cases as typical example of the Big Data applications that have being developed by the authors in the framework of the CYCLONE project. The effective use of cloud for bioinformatics applications requires maximum automation of the applications deployment and management that may include resources from multiple clouds and providers. The proposed CYCLONE platform for multicloud multiprovider applications deployment and management is based on the SlipStream cloud automation platform and includes all necessary components to build and operate complex scientific applications. The chapter discusses existing platforms for cloud powered applications development and deployment automation, in particularly referring to the SlipStream cloud automation platform, which allows multicloud applications deployment and management. The chapter also includes a short overview of the existing Big Data platforms and services provided by the major cloud services providers which can be used for fast deployment of customer Big Data applications using the benefits of cloud technologies and global cloud infrastructure.},

Windows Server 2012 includes a number of new features and technologies that enhance your ability to control access to information contained on your network file servers. The major advance in this area is Dynamic Access Control, which makes it possible for you to use claims-based authorization for accessing information on your file servers. This means that you are no longer limited to conventional user/group-based access control. Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 also introduced a new method for logging onto computers called Picture Password. With Picture Password, the user can select a picture and then perform a number of gestures on the picture. The picture and the gestures are packaged with the user's user name and password. The user can then log on by being presented with the picture and repeating the gestures, which will open the package and expose the user name and password to the system. In this chapter, we will look at how these technologies work and how to implement them.},

Thus accurate prediction of the availability of these resources can significantly improve the performance of executing compute-intensive complex scientific and business applications in enterprise Grid environment by avoiding possible runtime failures. In this paper, we propose a Jaccard Index based prediction approach utilizing lazy learning algorithm that searches for a best match of a sequence pattern in the historical data in order to predict the availability of a particular machine in the system. We compare it against three other well known availability prediction techniques using simulation based study. The experimental results show that our Jaccard Index based prediction approach achieves better prediction accuracy with reduced computational complexity when compared to other similar techniques.},

This paper seeks to begin the process of designing data protection controls into clouds from the outset so as to avoid the costs associated with bolting on security as an afterthought. Our approach is firstly to consider cloud maturity from an enterprise level perspective, describing a novel capability maturity model. We use this model to explore privacy controls within an enterprise cloud deployment, and explore where there may be opportunities to design in data protection controls as exploitation of the Cloud matures. We demonstrate how we might enable such controls via the use of design patterns. Finally, we consider how Service Level Agreements (SLAs) might be used to ensure that third party suppliers act in support of such controls.},

Providing solutions to this problem, the methods and tools of privacy-preserving data publishing enable the publication of useful information while protecting data privacy. Introduction to Privacy-Preserving Data Publishing: Concepts and Techniques presents state-of-the-art information sharing and data integration methods that take into account privacy and data mining requirements. The first part of the book discusses the fundamentals of the field. In the second part, the authors present anonymization methods for preserving information utility for specific data mining tasks. The third part examines the privacy issues, privacy models, and anonymization methods for realistic and challenging data publishing scenarios. While the first three parts focus on anonymizing relational data, the last part studies the privacy threats, privacy models, and anonymization methods for complex data, including transaction, trajectory, social network, and textual data. This book not only explores privacy and information utility issues but also efficiency and scalability challenges. In many chapters, the authors highlight efficient and scalable methods and provide an analytical discussion to compare the strengths and weaknesses of different solutions.},

Using big data mining, organizations are able to extract useful evidences from these large data sets. In spite of big data gains, there are numerous challenges also and among these challenges maintaining data privacy is the most important concern in big data mining applications since processing large scale of sensitive data sets such as health record, banking transaction records needs to be maintained in such a way that the private data should not be revealed to any unauthorized person.

Data is collected from multiple distributed sources by business organizations, government agencies, and healthcare sectors. Data collected is mined to uncover valuable data, and the insights they provide are used by these organizations for optimized decision making. Data thus amassed may also contain sensitive personal information of individuals that are at risk of disclosure during analytics. Hence, there is a need for a privacy-aware system that enforces sensitive data protection. But such a system constrains the usefulness of data. Study shows that although significant findings do exist for balancing these contradicting objectives, the efficacy and scalability of these solutions continue to challenge the research community, given the volume of Big Data. Assessing the appropriate blend of these objectives for mutual benefit of organizations and customers requires leveraging the benefit of the modern tools and technologies in the Big Data ecosystem.

  abstract = {Big data is an important driver of disruptive innovation that may increase organizations' competitive advantage. To create innovative data combinations and decrease investments, big data is often shared among organizations, crossing organizational boundaries. However, these big data collaborations need to balance disruptive innovation and compliance to a strict data protection regime in the EU. This paper investigates how inter-organizational big data collaborations arrange and govern their activities in the context of this dilemma. We conceptualize big data as inter-organizational systems and build on IS and Organization Theory literature to develop four archetypical governance arrangements: Market, Hierarchy, Bazaar and Network. Subsequently, these arrangements are investigated in four big data collaboration use cases. The contributions of this study to literature are threefold. First, we conceptualize the organization behind big data collaborations as IOS governance. Second, we show that the choice for an inter-organizational governance arrangement highly depends on the institutional pressure from regulation and the type of data that is shared. In this way, we contribute to the limited body of research on the antecedents of IOS governance. Last, we highlight with four use cases how the principles of big data, specifically data maximization, clash with the principles of EU data protection regulation. Practically, our study provides guidelines for IT and innovation managers how to arrange and govern the sharing of data among multiple organizations.},

  abstract = {Over the last years, big data has emerged as a new paradigm for the processing and analysis of massive volumes of data. Big data processing has been combined with service and cloud computing, leading to a new class of services called “Big Services”. In this new model, services can be seen as an abstract layer that hides the complexity of the processed big data. To meet users' complex and heterogeneous needs in the era of big data, service reuse is a natural and efficient means that helps orchestrating available services' operations, to provide customer on-demand big services. However different from traditional Web service composition, composing big services refers to the reuse of, not only existing high-quality services, but also high-quality data sources, while taking into account their security constraints (e.g., data provenance, threat level and data leakage). Moreover, composing heterogeneous and large-scale data-centric services faces several challenges, apart from security risks, such as the big services' high execution time and the incompatibility between providers' policies across multiple domains and clouds. Aiming to solve the above issues, we propose a scalable approach for big service composition, which considers not only the quality of reused services (QoS), but also the quality of their consumed data sources (QoD). Since the correct representation of big services requirements is the first step towards an effective composition, we first propose a quality model for big services and we quantify the data breaches using L-Severity metrics. Then to facilitate processing and mining big services' related information during composition, we exploit the strong mathematical foundation of fuzzy Relational Concept Analysis (fuzzy RCA) to build the big services' repository as a lattice family. We also used fuzzy RCA to cluster services and data sources based on various criteria, including their quality levels, their domains, and the relationships between them. Finally, we define algorithms that parse the lattice family to select and compose high-quality and secure big services in a parallel fashion. The proposed method, which is implemented on top of Spark big data framework, is compared with two existing approaches, and experimental studies proved the effectiveness of our big service composition approach in terms of QoD-aware composition, scalability, and security breaches.},

  abstract  = {The detection and handling of data leakages is becoming a critical issue for organizations. To this end, data leakage solutions are usually employed by organizations to monitor network traffic and the use of portable storage devices. These solutions often produce a large number of alerts, whose analysis is time-consuming and costly for organizations. To effectively handle leakage incidents, organizations should be able to focus on the most severe incidents. Therefore, alerts need to be prioritized with respect to their severity. This work presents a novel approach for the quantification of data leakages based on their severity. The approach quantifies leakages with respect to the amount and sensitivity of the leaked information as well as the ability to identify the data subjects of the leaked information. To specify and reason on data sensitivity in an application domain, we propose a data model representing the knowledge in the domain. We validate our approach by analyzing data leakages within a healthcare environment.},

abstract = {The collection of digital information by governments, corporations, and individuals has created tremendous opportunities for knowledge- and information-based decision making. Driven by mutual benefits, or by regulations that require certain data to be published, there is a demand for the exchange and publication of data among various parties. Data in its original form, however, typically contains sensitive information about individuals, and publishing such data will violate individual privacy. The current practice in data publishing relies mainly on policies and guidelines as to what types of data can be published and on agreements on the use of published data. This approach alone may lead to excessive data distortion or insufficient protection. Privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) provides methods and tools for publishing useful information while preserving data privacy. Recently, PPDP has received considerable attention in research communities, and many approaches have been proposed for different data publishing scenarios. In this survey, we will systematically summarize and evaluate different approaches to PPDP, study the challenges in practical data publishing, clarify the differences and requirements that distinguish PPDP from other related problems, and propose future research directions.},
